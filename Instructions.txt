you can set up a Linux-like environment using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL allows you to run a full Linux distribution on Windows, which is especially useful for developing and testing DPDK


STEP 1:
Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
    wsl --install
Open Ubuntu: Once WSL is installed, search for "Ubuntu" in your Start Menu, launch it, and complete the initial setup (username and password creation).

STEP 2:
Update Package Lists:
    sudo apt update
Install Build Essentials and Required Tools:
    sudo apt install -y build-essential meson ninja-build libnuma-dev git

STEP 3:
Clone the DPDK Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk.git
    cd dpdk

Configure the Build with Meson:
    meson setup build

Compile DPDK:
    ninja -C build
